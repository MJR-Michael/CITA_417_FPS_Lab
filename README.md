How to Play
Simply CLick play and the game will start you in the main arena mode. WASD for movement, Mouse for aiming, Left click and right click for firing and scope. There are gun pickups you can collect to defeat enemies.

Performance Section
There is a higher ground area where a bunch of Suzan heads will spawn in an area with light. This is supposed to add stress to the game by introducing GPU load through the meshees it has to render, collision physics, 

Whats the goal
You technically can win, but there is no point. this was mainly just to see how far I can push the performance of a regular game enviorment clashed with a heavy load going on seemingly in the background.
